## üìä Key Insights from the HR Data Analytics Project
Attrition Analysis

Identified key factors contributing to employee attrition such as job satisfaction, monthly income, years at company, and work-life balance.

Noted higher attrition among younger employees, those with less experience, and lower income brackets.

Department-wise Trends

The Sales department exhibited the highest attrition rate.

R&D had the most stable workforce, indicating better employee engagement or alignment with job roles.

Work-Life Balance Impact

Employees rating work-life balance as 1 (poor) had a significantly higher probability of leaving.

Suggests that enhancing work-life policies could improve retention.

Income and Promotion Gaps

Employees who hadn't been promoted in over 4 years were more likely to leave.

Indicates that career stagnation is a strong attrition driver.

Job Satisfaction Correlation

Job satisfaction levels of 1 and 2 (low) are highly correlated with high attrition rates.

Reinforces the need for regular satisfaction surveys and role optimization.

Tenure & Loyalty Patterns

Employees with 0‚Äì2 years of experience showed the highest turnover, signaling a potential issue in onboarding or early job fit.

Distance from Home

Slight trend: Employees living further away from office locations had slightly higher attrition rates, suggesting location flexibility could help.
